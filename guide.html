                <p>There are some items you need in order to start your bokashi composting. </p>
                <p><strong>The bokashi bran.</strong> Without the bokashi bran there will be no fermentation of your food scraps. The bran is made from wheat and is pre-fermented with bokashi bacterias. The bran can be found in garden stores and bigger supermarkets. You can also order it online from numerous vendors. </p>
                <p><strong>The buckets.</strong> There are special buckets for the bokashi composting method with a tap for collecting “bokashi tea”, however, they are quite expensive and if you are unsure it this method works for you this cost might be a problem. However, you don’t really need them! Look for buckets, 10-12 litres, with tight sealing lids. The bokashi bacterias don’t like air so the tight sealing lids are important. </p>
                <p>Thats all, this would cost you about 200 SEK in total. 100 SEK for 1kg bokashi bran and two buckets, with lids, is about 100 SEK. That is a fairly reasonable amount of money and if you get hooked you can start buying the fancy bokashi buckets with taps and what nots.</p>

                        <p>Prepare the bucket, I usually line it with a couple sheets of newspaper and then sprinkle it with approximately a table spoon of  the bokashi bran.</p>
                        <p>For my own convenience i keep the bucket in the cupboard under my kitchen sink. This is also where i keep a glass jar with the bokashi bran.</p>
                        <p>I'm a lazy person, so i have a smaller container on my work surface for the food scraps. when its half full (takes two days) i empty it in the big bucket.</p>

                        <p>Prepare your scraps of food. The finer you chop the faster it ferments and breaks down. Anything you can eat you can add to the bucket. Cooked or raw, it doesn't matter. You can add bones from chicken, fish, meat and prawn peels. As long as it is minimal of liquid you cant really smell anything.</p>
                        <p>There are some things to avoid.<br>
                        <strong>No mouldy or rotten food. No liquids. No soil.</strong><br>
                        The fermentation will be disturbed by these.</p>

                    <div class="guide-text">
                        <p>Add food to the bucket, no more than a kilo (about an inch) per layer. Sprinkle about 1-2 table spoons of bokashi bran on the top.</p>
                        <p>I use an empty container to pack the scraps tight in the bucket to get rid of air to help with the fermentation. If it feels a bit wet i add some pages of news paper, tissue paper or egg cartons to absorb the liquid.</p>
                        <p>Repeat until bucket is full!</p>

                    <div class="guide-text">
                        <p>When the bucket is full it needs two more weeks of fermentation before the content can be dug down or stored away in a cool place. 
                            If the temperature is below 15c the process stops so you need to find somewhere fairly warm.
                            I always check the date when my bucket is full and put a marker with a date when the fermentation is done. Makes it a lot easier to see which bucket i can store away outside or in the garage.</p>

                        <p>With the fermentation done it is time to return the food back to the ground to make great and nutritious soil!
                            This part can be a bit smelly because of lactic acid created during the fermentation.</p>
                        <p>I dig a hole or a trench and add the composted food. The most important here is to make sure the compost comes in contact with the soil. I mix the compost with some soil before covering it with the rest of the dug up soil. In 2-5 weeks all but the bones and eggshells are turned to soil!</p>
